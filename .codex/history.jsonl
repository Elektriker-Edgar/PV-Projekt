Read and analyze the feature specification to understand:\n   - The feature requirements and user stories\n   - Functional and non-functional requirements\n   - Success criteria and acceptance criteria\n   - Any technical constraints or dependencies mentioned\n\n3. Read the constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` to understand constitutional requirements.\n\n4. Execute the implementation plan template:\n   - Load `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` (already copied to IMPL_PLAN path)\n   - Set Input path to FEATURE_SPEC\n   - Run the Execution Flow (main) function steps 1-9\n   - The template is self-contained and executable\n   - Follow error handling and gate checks as specified\n   - Let the template guide artifact generation in $SPECS_DIR:\n     * Phase 0 generates research.md\n     * Phase 1 generates data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md\n     * Phase 2 generates tasks.md\n   - Incorporate user-provided details from arguments into Technical Context: $ARGUMENTS\n   - Update Progress Tracking as you complete each phase\n\n5. Verify execution completed:\n   - Check Progress Tracking shows all phases complete\n   - Ensure all required artifacts were generated\n   - Confirm no ERROR states in execution\n\n6. Report results with branch name, file paths, and generated artifacts.\n\nUse absolute paths with the repository root for all file operations to avoid path issues.\n"}
